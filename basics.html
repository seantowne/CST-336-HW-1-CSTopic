                        <h3>Some Essential Commands</h3>
                        <p class="tutorial-paragraph">
                        Open up your terminal if you are on Mac or a Linux distrobution. If you are on windows
                        go down to the Apple store and get yourself a real computer. Lets familiarize ourselves
                        with some basic commands. Pwd will print your current, working, directory. Mkdir will
                        make a new directory for you. Ls will list the files and direcctories in your current
                        working directory. Lets try it.

                            <code>
                                $ pwd
                                /tutorial
                                $ mkdir test
                                $ ls
                                test

                        <h3>Change Directory</h3>
                        <p class="tutorial-paragraph">
                        The 'cd' command changes your current directory. You can give
                        it an absolute path like '/Users/username/Desktop/vacationPhotos/' or you can give it a 
                        relative path like 'vacationPhotos/" if you are in the same directory as the folder you
                        are trying to navigate to. Two handy arguments for cd are './' and '../'. They are
                        "current directory" and "parent directory" respectively. Lets try it
                        </p>

                                $ pwd
                                /tutorial/test
                                $ cd ../
                                $ pwd
                                /tutorial
                                $ cd ./
                                $ pwd
                                /tutorial

                        <h3>Making, Moving, Copying, Viewing and Editing files</h3>
                        <p class="tutorial-paragraph">
                            You can make a file with the touch command. Mv will move or rename your files, it takes two arguments,
                            first is the file you want to move/rename, second is the place you want to move it too and the name you
                            want it to have. Cp is just like move except that it makes a copy of the file specified. One very simple
                            way to add text to a file is to use echo, and once you have text inside the file, one way to view it is
                            the cat command. Lets see..

                            <code>
                                $ touch file
                                $ ls
                                file  test
                                $ mv file file.txt
                                $ ls
                                file.txt  test
                                $ cp file.txt fileCopy.txt
                                $ ls
                                fileCopy.txt  file.txt  test
                                $ echo "Some Text" >> file.txt 
                                $ cat file.txt 
                                Some Text
                            </code>

                        <p>
                            I recomend using a regular old text editor to edit files and later in this turorial, scripts. Click on the 
                            Scripts tab of this site to move on to actually making a script!
