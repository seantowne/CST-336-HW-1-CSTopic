                <h3>What is Bash?</h3>
                <p>"Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system" (gnu.org).
                what does that mean? Bash is a relic from when computers didn't have the sophisticated GUIs we
                we enjoy today. Back in the day, if you wanted your computer to do something, you typed a command
                into the screen and hit enter. That old school way of interfacing with a computer was kept around
                as a window application for most modern operating systems. Bash is used by unix derived operating
                systems and Batch is used by Windows. If you use a windows machine, what are you doing? Upgrade to
                Unix based MacOS so that you can start doing some bash scripting!</p>
