                <h3>What is Bash?</h3>
                <p>
                "Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system" <a class=".resourceLink" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/What-is-Bash_003f.html">(gnu.org)</a>.
                what does that mean? Bash is a relic from when computers didn't have the sophisticated GUIs we
                we enjoy today. Back in the day, if you wanted your computer to do something, you typed a command
                into the screen and hit enter. That old school way of interfacing with a computer was kept around
                as a window application for most modern operating systems. Bash is used by unix derived operating
                systems and Batch is used by Windows. If you use a windows machine, what are you doing? Upgrade to
                Unix based MacOS so that you can start doing some bash scripting!
                </p>
                
                <h3>What is Scripting?</h3>
                <p>
                    Scripting with Bash is just like scripting with any other language. You can save a list of
                    Bash commands in a file and then run the file. When the file runs, it goes through and runs
                    each command inside of it. Bash has some features of normal progaming languages, such as support
                    for creating variables, functions, loops, and discisions like if else. Bash is close to the operating
                    system, you can switch directories easily, make and delete files easily, and do all kinds of things
                    with a four letter command that would be much harder to do from a program in another language.
