                    <h3>The Path variable</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unix like operating systems use a $PATH variable to indicate to
                        bash where it can find the programs it runs. If we want to be able
                        to have the bash shell know what we mean when we type myScript, we
                        need to add it to a directory listed in the path variable. If we show
                        the contents of path, we will see all the bin directories where bash 
                        commands live.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            $ echo $PATH
                            /path/to/binaries:/another/path/to/commands:/and/another
                        </code>

                    <h3>Our Own Path</h3>
                    <p>
                        Lets make our own directory and add its path to the path variable so
                        that we have a place for our custom scripts. We could add our scripts to 
                        an existing directory listed in the path variable... but thats ugly. Many of
                        those directories are meant for system use, and we don't want to lose track of 
                        the ones that came with the system and the ones we make. Once we have added to the 
                        path variable, lets move our script to our new Commands directory.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            $ mkdir ~/Commands
                            $ PATH=$PATH:/Your/Path/To/Your/Home/Directory/Commands 
                            $ mv myScript ~/Commands 
                        </code>

                    <h3>Run Our Script from Anywhere!</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that bash knows where to find our script, we can run it from
                        any directory! Another perk is that now we don't have to use the './'
                        before the name of our script for bash to know that it is an excecutable
                        that we want to run.

                            $ cd ~/Some/Random/Directory
                            $ myScript 
                            Hello, World
                        </code>

                    <p>
                        We just made a bash script that bash will treat like one of its own built in
                        commands. We can run it from any directory. Can you see the utility of this?
                        One thing I like to do is write python scripts that do something I find usefull
                        and then write a bash script that simply calls the python program. I even used a
                        bash script to test and upload this website! Here it is, it simply runs all the 
                        git and heroku commands that one would normally call to save their code and push it 
                        to the cloud, it is saved in an executable file named deploy, but it is not in a path 
                        directory.
